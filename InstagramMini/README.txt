Hello Guys,
This is My  Project Instagram  Mini Which is built using Javascript and Frontend Technologies. I've used Object-oriented
programming to build it.


Note:Please Open this App only in Desktop as it is made considering  Desktop only.If you want to check it out then please visit here https://instagrampc.netlify.app/.
And Your seeing why this resources files are randomly distributed instead of placing them in one single file? Due to some technical issue I had to construct it like this

Instruction to Use:
*Firstly Allow Camera Permission then you are good to go.

When you open this App you will see Reel section where you can find some filters, check out them. Then we have the Page button at the bottom, that would make you go to the Reels page where you will see some reels. All the buttons other than this are dummy. When you are in the Reel page if you want to go back look for the blue button at the top left which would take you back to the previous page. And Yeah that's all.
Thank you for Visiting.
