### Resume Builder using JS
This project will let you build and download your resume.
You can add more fields in the resume as I commented the code file properly.

### How to use it?
1. Downlaod the Zip file of `Amazing-Js-Project` (i.e., this repository) and extract it.
2. Open `Resume-Builder` folder and go to `index.html` file.
3. You can open `index.html` file using any brower.

### Refrence
I took reference and understood the JavaScript logic by watching the video <a href="https://youtu.be/sGEu_3O5emc">click here</a>. <br>
This project helped me to undertand the logic and different use of js functions and properties.<br>
Rest all was fully coded by me.
