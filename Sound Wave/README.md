# Introduction
<br>
This website contains a simulation that depicts displacement and pressure waves built inside two types of tubes which are one end closed and both ends open. Simulation insvolves two modes, static and dynamic. In static mode one can view the static waveform and also get the required amplitude at a corresponding place inside the tube. In dynamic mode the standing wave vibrations are simulated.

# Home Page
<br>
This page contains two links which redirects us to two different pages. The two pages are for two different type of tubes.

# Close ended and open ended tube pages

## Part one
<br>
These two pages are similar except for the different waveforms obtained accordingly. In each of these pages it first shows a place where we need to input the length of the tube and the mode of the waveform (fundamental, first harmonic, second harmonic, so on) as required parameters. Next we need to input the amplitude of the displacement and pressure waves which are optional fields and if not provided the default value assumed is 1.

>### Note: In case of one end closed tube the available modes of vibration are odd numbers only like 1, 3, 5, ...
<br>

## Part two
<br>
After submitting the required parameters we land on the display page. Here we will observe two lines of information on the top. These tell us how to use the webpage. We first need to select the type of wave we aim to visulize which may be displacement or pressure. Next we need to select the mode of display which can be static or dynamic. In case static waveform is chosen, we need to position the horizontal dotted line on our screen such that it passes through the middle of our tube. Doing this will enable one to hover on the waveform and get the amplitude of the corresponding wave at any point inside the tube. These fields are displayed on the top of the tube. Also, a little adjustment may be needed sometimes regarding the positioning of the horizontal line depending on browsers.
