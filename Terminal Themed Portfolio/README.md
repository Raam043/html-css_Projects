## Description
This is a terminal themed portfolio website made using basic HTML , CSS and JavaScript
- I have implement basic typing animations using JavaScript and syntax highlighting using CSS althought this website doesn't take any inputs
- I have icncluded links to my games , GitHub , socials etc .
- I made use of *GitHub pages* to host my website and free domain from *name.com* as part of the GitHub student's developer pack 
## Use
If you want to use the same type of style for your own website :
- clone the repository
- make necessary changes to the .txt file like replace the text in it with what you want to be displayed on the site (rename it to whatever you want but make sure you make the changes in the JavaScript code as well otherwise it will not be able to find the .txt file and your website will display nothing)
